# Programming languages

### Variable
Variables are like containers. we can use these containers to store data during program execution. we can mention a name for identify a particular container. So those named Containers are called variables. we can manipulate the data in the containers by reffering that variable name.

we can store different types of data in the containers.

### Function
A function is a block of reusable code to perform a specific action.  
A Function is executed when calls it.  
We can use the same code many times with different arguments, to produce different results (We can reuse code ).

### Data Structures
Data Structures allow us to store and organize data efficiently.
This will allow us to easily access and perform operations on the data.

##### Condiotional Control Statement
The Conditional Statement allows you to execute a block of code based on a condition.

### Looping Statements
Loops allow us to execute a block of code several times. 


##### while Loop
While loop allows us to execute a block of code several times as long as the condition is `True`.

##### for Loop
The `for` loop is used to execute a block of code a known number of times. The `for` statement iterates over each item of a sequence.

### OOPS
`OOPs : Object-Oriented Program`
Object-Oriented Programming is a way of approaching, designing and developing software.
Proper usage of OOPs concepts helps us build well-organized systems that are easy to use and extend.
* Easier way to analyse
* Reusability of code through inheritance
* Effective problem solving
