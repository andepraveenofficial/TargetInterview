Insta Share

This is Insta Share Application.
It almost like Instagram Clone.
I created this entire project with React.
I have spent 7 days for completing this project.

For this project I used 
* Functional Components with React Hooks.
* Global State management purpose I used React context for Avoiding Prop Drilling.
* I used js-cookies third party package for store the jwt_token in Cookies Storage of Browser.
* In this application, I created Rich UI components with Figma Design.
