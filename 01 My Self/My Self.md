### Self Introduction

First of all,
Thank you, sir, for giving me this opportunity to introduce myself.

##### `My Journey`
After My Graduation, I worked at __JAY ENGINEERING WORKS__ company in Chennai as a Quality Control Engineer & CNC Programmer.  

I have a strong interest in learning programming languages, so I completed an __Industry Ready Certification__ course in Full-stack Development with __MERN__ specialization from __Nxtwave__.  

##### `Skills`

During my full-stack training, I learned various technologies:

On the **Frontend** side, I learned `HTML`, `CSS`, `Bootstrap`, `JavaScript`, and `React`.

On the **Backend** side, I acquired knowledge on `Node.js`, `Express.js`, and `Python`.

On the **Database** side, I learned `SQLite` database.

I also gained some experience in using Git and GitHub for version control.

So I have hands-on experience on MERN stack technologies,

##### `Projects`

During my fullstack training I have built many  __static__, __Responsive__ and __Dynamic__ websites.  
I developed __Todo Application__ with Javascript and also created __Wikipedia Search Application__ using `Javascript` and `API calls`.

I have built __Instashare__ React Application, It is almost like Instagram clone. For this project I used `Functional components with React Hooks`, `API calls` and `Cookies Storage`.

currently I am learning `MongoDB` database...

##### Achievements
My achievement is that I recently participated in 100-days code challenge and successfully completed that challenge.

During that challenge, I consistently updated my learning progress of coding every day for 100 days on __LinkedIn__.

As a result,  I received a certificate from __Nxtwave__.
